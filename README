Easy FTP is a lightweight, easy to use gem created by Stellios.

In his bid for world domination, and since EasyCafe went down the pan he has turned his glare upon the the complexity of FTP.
To date the great one has introduced luggage charges and now a simple to use FTP interface.
This is currently free to use for a trial period, however in the near future you will be subject to weight restrictions.

ATM we only support EasyFTP.put( local_path_to_file, connection_details ) which copies a local file to a remote dir.
The connection_details should be in the form of a hash, with keys as strings.

All keys are mandatory apart from 'upload_directory'.

For example:
{
    'hostname' => "123.45.67.8",
    'port' => "21",
    'user' => "billy_bob".
    'password' => 'password',
    'upload_directory' => '/change/to/remote/dir'    # optional
}
